## Hey there, curious ones! Welcome to my GitHub lair. Grab a cup of coffee/tea, pull up a chair, and enjoy the wild ride through my code! Warning: occasional bugs, bad jokes, and a relentless passion for programming ahead. Happy browsing!

I'm Prajwal, a student at Politecnico di Torino. If it was not already obvious, I LOVE to code!

ðŸ”­ My goal? To harness the power of machine learning and craft apps that don't just solve problems but make the world a little more awesome, one algorithm at a time. Because if we're going to teach machines to think, they might as well think about making life better for all of us!

ðŸŒ± Fueled by an insatiable love for coding and a constant thirst for knowledge, I've not only mastered key programming languages like C, Python, JavaScript, Java, and MySQL, but also ventured way beyond whatâ€™s taught at my university. From self-teaching JavaScript to exploring the depths of topics they don't even dare to cover in class, I'm always coding my way to something new and exciting!

âœ¨ I'm currently diving into object-oriented programming in Java and exploring Swift to create sleek, powerful applications across platforms. As I sharpen my skills to build scalable, maintainable software that solves real-world problems, I'm also rolling up my sleeves and contributing to open-source projects on GitHub, turning theory into action and making my mark in the coding community!

ðŸ’¬ I invite you to play the programmer's edition of truth or dare! Iâ€™m picking truth, but hereâ€™s your dare: give me a problem to solve in C, Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript or Swift, (I'm still learning those last two, but who doesnâ€™t love a challenge?) and watch me code my way to a solution! Then you can decide if Iâ€™m the one whoâ€™s about to fix your bugsâ€¦ or maybe just join your team to build something awesome together!

âš¡ Fun Fact: I juggle six languages like a pro, and when I'm not sleuthing through mystery novels or hunting down the perfect Wordle guess, I'm off exploring uncharted corners of the globe or catching thrills mid-air while paragliding. I love the oceanâ€™s beauty from the shore but admit it freaks me out a little (thereâ€™s just so much lurking in the deep!). And when I need a break from all that adventure, youâ€™ll find me happily lost in a movie that takes me to places even my passport canâ€™t reach!

ðŸ“« And that's just a glimpse into my world! If you're looking for someone who brings curiosity, creativity, and a can-do attitude to every challenge, then letâ€™s talk. Whether it's crafting smarter algorithms, building cutting-edge apps, or just exchanging ideas over a virtual coffee, I'm eager to bring my passion and skills to your team. Donâ€™t miss outâ€”drop me a line at [prajwalmoras10@gmail.com], let's team up and craft something epic!
